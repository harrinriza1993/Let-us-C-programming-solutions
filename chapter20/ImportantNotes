Important notes:
-----------------

1) Command-line arguments are arguments provided to main() from command line.
	
2) Command-line arguments are collected in main() in variables argc and argv
	argc - Count of arguments
	argv - Vector(array) of arguments
	Any variable names other than argc, argv are ok.

3) char *argv[] is an array of pointers to strings. So all arguments are
   received as strings and their addresses are stored in argv[].
   
4) Errors in reading / Writing from / to a file can be detected using ferror()
   and reported using perror().

5) Most OSs predefine pointers of three standard files :
	stdin  - standard input device(Keyboard)
	stdout - standard output device - monitor
	stdder - standard error device - monitor
