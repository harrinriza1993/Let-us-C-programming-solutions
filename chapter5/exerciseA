[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
      int i = 1;
      while(i<10)
      {
          printf("%d\n", i);
          i++;
      }
      return 0;
   }

   Output:
   1 
   2 
   4 
   5 
   6 
   7 
   8 
   9

   Notes:Since we have the while condition, less 
	 than 10 it prints the value from 1 to 9.
	 when i value become 10, the while condition is failed.

b. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int x = 4, y, z;
       y = --x;
       z = x--;
       printf("%d %d %d\n",x,y,z);
       return 0;
   }

   Output:
	2
	3
	3

   Notes: 1. y = --x, first decrements x then assign the decremented value to y [y = 3]
	  2. z = x--, first assigns the value of x to z [z=3] then decrement x
	  3. The value of x is decremented twice. so the value of x is 2 [x = 2]. 

c. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int x = 4, y = 3, z;
       z = x---y;
       printf("%d %d %d\n",x,y,z);
       return 0;
   }

   Output: 3
           3
	   1

   Notes : 1. z = x---y, Here Fist it does (x-y) and assign the value to z [z = 1]
	   2. X value will be decremented [x = 3]
           3. Y value does not changed [y = 3]

d. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       while('a' < 'b')
	  printf("malayalam is palindrome\n");
       return 0;
   }

   Output: malayalam is palindrome 
	   (Printed infinity number of times)

   Notes : The decimal value of 'a' is 97 and 'b' is 98
           In while condition, the ascii value of 'a' is always greater than 'b' which is always
	   true so it prints the statement to infinity times.


e. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int i;
       while(i=10)
       {
           printf("%d\n",i);
           i = i+1;
       }
       return 0;
   }

   Output: 10
	   (priinted infinity number of times)

   Notes :  In while condition (used assignment operator) which assign the value of i to 10 [i = 10]
	    so the condition will be always true ,so 10 is printed infinity number of times


f. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       float x = 1.1;
       while(x == 1.1)
       {
           printf("%f\n",x);
           x = x-0.1;
       }
       return 0;
   }

   Output: No output 

   Notes : In the while condition, compares float with an integer (1.1).
	   so the condition becomes false.
