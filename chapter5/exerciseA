[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
      int i = 1;
      while(i<10)
      {
          printf("%d\n", i);
          i++;
      }
      return 0;
   }

   Output: It will print the value from 1 to 9
   1 
   2 
   4 
   5 
   6 
   7 
   8 
   9
   Notes:Since we have the while condition, less 
	 than 10 it prints the values from 1 to 9.
	 

b. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int x = 4, y, z;
       y = --x;
       z = x--;
       printf("%d %d %d\n",x,y,z);
       return 0;
   }

   Output:2
	  3
	  3
   Notes:Here the value of x is decremented twice so
	 the value of x is 2,--x first decrements x,
	 then assign the decremented value to y so the
	 value of y is 3,x-- first assigns the value 
	 to z then it decrements so the value of z is 3. 
	

c. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int x = 4, y=3, z;
       z = x---y;
       printf("%d %d %d\n",x,y,z);
       return 0;
   }

   Output: 3
           3
	   1
   Notes : Since x decrements once the value of x is 3,
	   the value of y is 3,the value of z is (4-3),
	   that is 1.


d. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       while('a' < 'b')
	  printf("malayalam is palindrome\n");
       return 0;
   }

   Output: malayalam is palindrome 
	   (Printed infinity number of times)
   Notes : In while condition the ascii value of a
	   is always greater than y which is always
	   true so it prints the statement to infinity 
	   times.


e. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       int i;
       while(i=10)
       {
           printf("%d\n",i);
           i = i+1;
       }
       return 0;
   }

   Output: 10
	   (priinted infinity number of times)
   Notes :  In while condition assignment operator is there
	    so the condition will be always true ,so 10 is 
	    printed infinity number of times


f. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
       float x = 1.1;
       while(x == 1.1)
       {
           printf("%f\n",x);
           x = x-0.1;
       }
       return 0;
   }

   Output: No output 
   Notes : 1.1 in while condition is taken as an integer so when we 
	   compare the values the condition becomes false since x is
	   a float value.If we typecast float in while condition we 
	   get output.
