### Chapter 9 : Pointers

### [A] What will be the output of the following program

- This one is covered in `exerciseA` file.

### [B] Point out the errors, if any, in the following program

- This one is covered in `exerciseB` file.

### [c] Attempt the following

**a.c** : Write a function that receives 5 integers and returns the sum,
          average, and standard deviation of these numbers.call this function from main() and print the results in main().

**b.c**: Write a function that receives marks obtained by a student in 3 subjects and returns the average and percentage of these marks.call this function from main() and print the results in main().

**c.c**: Write a C function to evulate the series

	sin(x) = x - (x^3/3!) + (x^5/5!) - (x^7/7!)+....
up to 10 terms.

**d.c**: Given three variables x,y,z Write a function to circularly shift their values to right .In other words if x = 5,y = 8, z = 10,after circular shift y = 5,z = 8,x = 10.Call the function with variables a,b,c to circularly shift values.

**e.c**: If the length of the sides of a triangle are denoted by a,b and c then area of triangle is given by 

		 area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))
         where s = (a+b+c)/2.
Write a function to calculate the area of the triangle.

**f.c**: Write a function to compute the distance between two points and use it to develop another function that will compute the area of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1,y1),B(x2,y2)andC(x3,y3).Use these functions to develop a function which returns a value 1 if the point (x,y) lies inside the triangle ABC, otherwise returns a value 0.

**f.c**: Write a function to compute the greatest common divisor given by Euclid's algorithm ,exemplified for j = 1980,k= 1617 as follows	

	1980/1617 = 1     	1980-1*1617 = 363
	1617/363 = 4 		1617-4*363 = 165
	363/165 = 2		363-2*165 = 33
	5/33 = 5		165-5*33 = 0
Thus the greatest common divisor is 33.
