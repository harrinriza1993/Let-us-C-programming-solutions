Important notes:
-----------------

1. 3 ways to call a function:
   (a) call by value - When values are passed to the called function.
   (b) call by reference - When values arec passed to the called function.
   (c) Mixed call - when values and address are passed to the called function.

2. Pointers are variables which holds the address of other variable.

3. &,*- pointer operators
   & - Address of operator
   * - value at address 

4. call by value - change in formal arguments doesn't affect actual argumets
   call by refernce - Using formal arguments actual arguments can be changed.
