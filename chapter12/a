(a) If a macro is not getting expanded as per your expectation, how
    will you find out how is it being expanded by the preprocessor.

    Answer:
     	If for any reason,you are unable to debug a macro,then you
        should view the expanded code of the program to see how the
        macros are getting expanded.If your source code is present in
        PR1.C,then the expanded code source would be stored in PR1.I.
        You need to generate this file at the command prompt by saying:
  
	cpp pr1.c
	
	Here CPP stands for C Preprocessor. It generates the expanded 
        source code and stores it in a file called PR1.O.You can now 
   	open this file and see the expanded source code.
