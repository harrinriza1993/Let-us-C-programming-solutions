### Chapter 12 : The C Preprocessor

### [A] Answer the following

- This one is covered in `exerciseA` file.

### [B] What will be the output of the following program

- This one is covered in `exerciseB` file.

### [B] Attempt the following

**a** : If a macro is not getting expanded as per your expectation, how
will you find out how is it being expanded by the preprocessor.

**b.c**: Write down the macro definitions of the following:  
	 1. To test whether a character is a small case letter or not   
	 2. To test whether a case is an upper case letter or not.     
	 3. To test whether a character is an alphabet or not.  
	    Make use of the macros you defined in 1 and 2 above.   
	 4. To obtain bigger of two numbers  

**c.c**: Write a macro defintions with argument for calculation
of area and perimeter of a triangle, a square and a circle Store 
these macro defintions in a file called "areaperi.h". Include this 
file in your program, and call the macro definitionsfor calculating 
area and perimeter for different squares,triangles and circles.

**d.c**: Write down macro definitions for the following:  
	 1. To find arithmetic mean of two numbers.  
	 2. To find absolute value of a number.  	
	 3. To convert an upper case alphabet to lowercase.  
	 4. To obtain the biggest of three numbers.  

**e.c**: Write macro definitions with arguments for calculation of simple 
interest and amount. Store these macro definitionsin a file called "interest.h".
Include this file in ur program and use the macro definitions for calculating 
simple interest and amount.
