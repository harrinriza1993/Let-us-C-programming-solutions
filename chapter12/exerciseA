 	#define INCH PER FEET 12
	#define SQR(x) (x * x)
	#define SQR(x) x*x
	#define SQR(x) (x * x)

	Answer : SQR(x) (x * x)

(c) State True or False:
	1.A macro must always be written in capital letters - True
	2.A macro should accommodated in a single line - False
	3.After preprocessing when the program is sent for compilation
	  the macros are removed from expanded source code - False
	4.Macros with arguments are not allowed - False
	5.Nested macros are alowed - False
	6.In a macro the control is passed to the macro - True
 
(d) How many #include directives can be there in a given program file?

   Answer : Many number of #include directives can be there in a program
            It depends on the need in the program .

(e) What is the difference between the following two #include directives:

	#include<conio.h>

    Answer : #include"conio.h" - This command would look for the file conio.h

	2.#elseif
	3.#undef
	4.#pragma

   Answer : 2.#elseif

(h) All macro substitutions in a program are done:

	1.Before compilation of the program
	2.After compilation
	3.During execution
	4.None of the above

   Answer : 1.Before compilation of the program

(i) In a program the statement:

    #include "filename"
    is replaced by the contents of the file "filename":
	1.Before compilation 
	2.After compilation
	3.During execution

   Answer : 1.Before compilation
