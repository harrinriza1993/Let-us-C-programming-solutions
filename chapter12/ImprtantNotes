Important notes:
-----------------

1. C preprocessor is a program that process our program before 
   it is passed to the compiler.

2. The Preprocessor works on the source code and creates "Expanded
   source code' as per directives used in the source code

3. Each preprocessor directive begins with a # symbol.

4. 4 types of preprocessor directives
   (a)Macro expansion
   (b)File inclusion
   (c)Conditional compilation
   (d)Miscellneous directives

5. Macros - Every template is replaced by it's expansion
          - Macros have a global effect 
          - example : #define PI 3.14

6. Macros can take multiple arguments

7. Macros can be split over multiple lines.put a \ at the end of
   each line,except last line.

8. Macros are faster than functions but occupies more space.

9. conditional compilaton - compiles the code only if the
                            condition is true
                          - Implemented using #ifdef,#else,#endif
                            #ifndef,#if

10. Miscellaneous directives:
	#undef - undefines a macro that has already been defined
	#pragmainline - used for compilation of program that uses
	                assembly language statements

11. There are many other #pragma directives.
