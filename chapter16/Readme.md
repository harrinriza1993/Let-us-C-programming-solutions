### Chapter 16  :   Handling Multiple Strings  

### [A] Answer the following

**a** :  How many bytes in memory would be occupied by the following array of pointers
to a string? How many bytes would be required to store the same strings, if they
are stored in a two- dimensional character array?

		char *mess[] = {
				  "Hammer and tongs",
				  "Tooth and nail",
				  "spit and polish",
				  "You and C"
				};

**b.c**: Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str[] as given below.
Receive a string str1 and check if str1 is embedded in any of the strings in str[].

			char *str[] = {
					"We will teach you how to....",
					"Move a mountain",
			          	"Level a building",
					"Erase the past",
		 			"Make a million",
					"....all through C!"
				      };

**c.c**: Write a program to sort a set of names stored in an array in alphabetical 
order.

**d.c**: Write a program to reverse the strings stored in an array of pointers to 
strings.

**e.c**: Write a program to delete all vowels from a sentence. Assume that the sentence 
is not more than 80 characters long.

**f.c**: Write a program that will read a line and delete from it all occurences of the 
word 'the'.

**g.c**:  Write a program that takes a set of individuals and abbreviates the first and
middle name to their first letter.

**h.c**: Write a program to count the number of occurences of any two vowels in succession 
in a line of text. For example, in the following sentence:
	"Please read this application and give me gratuity"
	 such as occurences are ea, ea, ui.

**i.c**:  Write a program that receives an integer (less than or equal to nine digits in length) and 
prints out the number in words. For example if the input number is 12342, then output should be Twelve 
Thousand Three and Hundred Forty two.
