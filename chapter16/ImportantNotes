Important notes:
-----------------

1. 2 ways to handle multiple related strings:
	1) Using 2D array of strings
	2) Using array of pointers to strings

2. Pros and cons of using 2D array of strings
	prons:
		1) Easy to process using 2 for loops 
                   and expression str[i][j]

   	Cons:
		1) Leads to wastage of precious memory space
		2) leads to tedious processing of array elements

3. Pros and cons of using array of pointer to strings:

	Pros:
		1) Easy to process
		2) Saves space

	cons:
		1) Cannot change strings. Their relative positions in 
                   the array can be changed.
		2) Cannot receive strings from keyboard easily. Can be 
                   done by allocating space for each string using malloc()
                   and then assigning the addresses returned by malloc()
                   to the array elements.
