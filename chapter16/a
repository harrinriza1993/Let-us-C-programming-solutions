(a) How many bytes in memory would be occupied by the following array of pointers
    to a string? How many bytes would be required to store the same strings, if they
    are stored in a two- dimensional character array?

		char *mess[] = {
				  "Hammer and tongs",
				  "Tooth and nail",
				  "spit and polish",
				  "You and C"
				};

  Answer:
	   Total number of characters in mess is 64 . So array of pointers occupy 68
           bytes of memory including '\0' .

	   In two dimensional character array they are stored as rows and columns, Since
           there is 4 rows and 16 column the total number of bytes is 68 including '\0'.
