(b) Rewrite the following expressions using bitwise compound assignment operators :

	a = a | 3	a = a & 0x48	b = b ^ 0x22
	c = c << 2	d = d >> 4
	
Answer :
	 a = a | 3	   -->	 a |= 3 
	 a = a & 0x48   -->	 a &= ox48
	 b = b ^ 0x22   -->  b ^= 0x22
	 c = c << 2	    -->  c <<= 22
	 d = d >> 4     -->  d >>= 4
