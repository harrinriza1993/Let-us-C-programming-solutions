2) A bit can take a value 0 or 1.

3) Units : 
	4  bits = Nibble
	8  bits = Byte
	16 bits = Word
	32 bits = Dword
   
4) Errors in reading / Writing from / to a file can be detected using ferror()
   and reported using perror().

5) Bitwise Operations :
	Set a bit to a value 0/1 --> Write operation.
	Check whether bit 6 is 1(on) or 0(off) --> Read operation.
