[A] Answer the following:

(a) Ten floats are to be stored in memory. What would you prefer, an array or 
    a structure?
    
    Answer : An array.
	     Since we use same datatype 'float', and we know the size, array is preffered.
 
 (b) Given the statement,
 	
 	maruti.engine.bolts = 25;
 	
 	which of the following is True?
 	
 	1. Structure bolts is nested within structure engine
 	2. Structure engine is nested within structure maruti
 	3. Structure maruti is nested within structure engine
 	4. Structure maruti is nested within structure bolts
 	
 	Answer:  2. Structure engine is nested within structure maruti
  
  (c) State True or False
  
  	1. All structure elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. - True
  	
  	2. An array should be used to store dissimilar elements, and a structure
  	   to store similar elements. False
  	   
  	3. In an array of structures, not only are all structures stored in contiguous
  	   memory locations, but the elements of individual structures are also stored
  	   in contiguous locations. - True
  	   
   (d) struct time
       {
   		int hours; int minutes; int seconds;
   	}t;
   	
   	struct time *pt;
   	pt = &t;
   	
   	With reference to the above declarations Which of the following refers to the 
   	seconds correctly:
   	
   	1. pt.seconds
   	2. pt -> seconds
   	3. time.seconds
   	4. time -> seconds
   	
   	Answer : pt -> seconds
