Important notes:
-----------------

1. Structure is a collection of dissimilar elements stored in adjacent locations.

2. Structure is a user defined datatype. Using structure we can define a datatype
   which holds more than one element of differnt types.
 
 3. Syntax of structure is 
 	
 	struct employee
 	{
 		char name; int age; float salary;
 	};
 	
 	struct employee e1, e2, e[10];
 	
 	struct - Keyword         employee - Structure name/tag
 	name, age, salary - Structure elements/ structure members
 	e1, e2 - structure variables  e[] - Array of structures
 	
 4. size of structure variable = sum of sizes of structure elements.
 
 5. To access structure elements using structure variable, use . operator
    as in
    
    	struct emp e;
    	printf("%s %d %f", e.name, e.age, e.sal);
