[A] Which of the following are invalid C constants and why?

	'3.15'	35,550	     3.5e2
	2e-3	'eLearning'  "show"
	'Quest'  2^3         4 6 5 2   
	
Answer :

	The invalid C constants are 
		'3.15'  : float value can not be in a single quotes  
		'eLearning': String can not be in single quotes  
		'Quest': String can not be in single quotes  	
		35,550  - Since comma (,) is used in between numbers  
		4 6 5 2 - Since space is there inbetween numbers.
