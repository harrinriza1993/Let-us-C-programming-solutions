### [H] Attempt the following
- **a.c** : If a five digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. 
(Hint : Use the modulus operator %')

- **b.c** : If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number.

- **c.c** :  If length of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle.   

- **d.c** : Write a program to receive Cartesian co-ordinates(x, y) of a point and convert them in to polar co-ordinates(r, s)
       
       	Hint r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
       	and  s = tan^-1(y / x)
       
- **e.c** : Write a program to receive values of latitude(L1, L2) and longitude(G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output 
the distance(D) between them in nautical miles. The formula for distance in nautical miles is
       
       D = 3963 cos^-1(sinL1sinL2 + cosL1cosL2 *cos(G2 - G1)) 
       
- **f.c** : Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air 
temperature, and calculated as per the formula :
       
       wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16
where t is the temperature and v is the wind velocity. Write a program to receive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor(wcf). 

- **g.c** : If value of an angle is input through the keyboard, write a program to print all its Trignometric ratios.

- **h.c** : Two numbers are input through the keyboard into two locations C and D. Write a program to interchange the contents.

- **i.c** : Consider a currency system in which there are notes of seven denominations, namely,Re.1, Rs. 2, Rs.5, Rs.10, Rs.50, Rs.100. 
If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the Keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs.N.
