/*(q) A dequeue is an ordered set of elements in which the  elements
      may be inserted or retrieved from either end. Using an array
      simulate a dequeue of characters and the operations retrieve left,
      retrive right, insert left, insert right. Exceptional condition such
      as dequeue full or empty should be indicated. Two pointers(namely, left
      and right) are needed in this simulation.
