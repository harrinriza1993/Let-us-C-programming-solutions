[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>
   #include<ctype.h>

   int main()
   {
	char ch;
	
	ch = getchar();
	
	if(islower(ch))
		putchar(toupper(ch));
	else
		putchar(tolower(ch));
	
	return 0;
   }

   Output:
   	a - using getchar() we get the character from the user.
   	A
   	B - using getchar() we get the character from the user.
   	b

   Notes: If small alphabets are given as input, we get capital alphabets
          as output.
          If capital alphabets are given as input, we get small alphabets
          as output.
        
b. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 2;
	float f = 2.5367;
	char str[] = "Life is like that";
	
	printf("%4d\t%3.3f\t%4s\n", i, f, str);
	
	return 0;
   }

   Output:
   	  2	2.537	Life is like that

   Notes: The values are aligned according to the specifications in format specifiers.
   
c. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	printf("More often than\b\b not \rthe person who\ wins is the one who thinks he can!\n");
	
	return 0;
   }

   Output: 
   	the person who wins is the one who thinks he can!

   Notes : \b, \r and is used as Backspace and Carriage return.
   
d. #include<conio.h>

   char p[] = "The sixth sick sheikh's sixth ship is sick";

  int main()
  {
	int i = 0;
	
	while(p[i] != '\0')
	{
		putchar(p[i]);
		i++;
	}
	
	return 0;
   }
   Output: 
   	fatal error: conio.h: No such file or directory
   	compilation terminated.

   Notes : Since we doesn't use #include<stdio.h> in the above program, which 
           is a preprocessor directive for input and output files, this error occurs.
