[B] Point out the errors, if any, in the following programs:

a. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i;
	char a[] = "Hello";
	
	while(a != '\0')
	{
		printf("%c", *a);
		a++;
	}
	return 0;
   }

   Compiler error : lvalue required as increment operand

   Notes : The base address should be stored in a variable, so once the base address 
   	   is obtained in the variable would yield the value at address. Since it doesn't
           point to any variable, the base address a cannot be incremented and the 
           value cannot be printed.

b. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	double dval;
	
	scanf("%f", &dval);
	printf("Double val = %lf\n", dval);
	
	return 0;
   } 
   
   Compiler error : format ‘%f’ expects argument of type ‘float *’, but argument 2 has type ‘double *’ [-Wformat=]

   Notes : Since double is the datatype %lf should be used in format specifier instead of %f.

c. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int ival;
	
	scanf("%d\n", &n);
	printf("Integer Value = %d\n", ival);
	
	return 0;
   }

   Compiler error : ‘n’ undeclared (first use in this function)

   Notes : The variable declared in the program is ival, but n is used to get the input ,
           Which is not declared in the program.
            
d. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int dd, mm, yy;
	
	printf("Enter date in dd/mm/yy or dd-mm-yy format\n");
	scanf("%d%*c%d%*c%d", &dd, &mm, &yy);
	
	printf("The date is : %d -%d -%d\n", dd, mm, yy);
	
	return 0;
   }

   Error : No compilation and run time error.
   
   Notes : output is
   	   Enter date in dd/mm/yy or dd-mm-yy format
	   23 67 89
	   The date is : 23 -67 -89

e. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	char text;
	
	sprintf(text, "%4d\t%2.2f\n%s", 12, 3.452, "Merry Go Round");
	printf("%s\n", text);
	
	return 0;
   }

   Compiler error : passing argument 1 of ‘sprintf’ makes pointer from integer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]

   Notes :  text is a buffer which stores all value as a string but here declared text as a single character.
   
f. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	char buffer[50];
	int no = 97;
	double val = 2.34174;
	char name[10] = "Shweta";
	
	sprintf(buffer, "%d%lf%s", no, val, name);
	printf("%s\n", buffer);
	
	sscanf(buffer, "%4d%2.2lf%s", &no, &val, name);
	printf("%s\n", buffer);
	
	printf("%d%lf%s\n", no, val, name);
	return 0;
   } 

   Compiler error : unknown conversion type character ‘.’ in format [-Wformat=]
   
   Notes : We cannot be able to mention the format specification value in sscanf since it directly 
           gets the value from printf() function.
