[A] Answer the following:

(a) An array is a collection of:

	1.Different data types scattered throughout memory
	2.The same data type scattered throughout memory
	3.The same data type placed next to each other in memory
	4.Different data types placed to each other in memory

	Answer : 3.The same datatype scattered throughout memory

(b) Are the following array declarations correct?
 
 	int a(25);
	int size = 10,b[size];
	int c = {0,1,2};

	Answer : int a(25);-is wrong Since () is used instead of []
		 int size = 10,b[size];- is wrong b[size] should be in left
                 int c = {0,1,2};- is wrong since,array variable is not used

(c) Which element of the array does this expression reference?
	num[4]

	Answer : 5th element 
 
(d) What is the difference between the 5's in these two expressions?
	int num[5];
	num[5] = 11;
	
	1.First is particular element,second is type
	2.First is array size,second is particular element
	3.First is particular element,second is array size
	4.Both specify array size.

   Answer : 2.First is array size,second is particular element

(e) State whether the following statements are True or False
	
    1. The array int num[26] has twenty-six elements - False
    2. The expression num[1] designates the first element in the
       array - False
    3. It is necessary to initialize the array at the time of 
       declaration - True
    4. The expression num[27] designates the twenty-eighth element
       in the array - True
 
(f) What will happen if you try to put so many values into an array
    when you initialize it that the size of the array is exceeded?

	1.Nothing
	2.Possible system malfunction
	3.Error message from the compiler
	4.Other data maybe overwritten

	Answer : 2.Possible system malfunction

(g) What will happen if you put too few elements in an array when you
    initialize it?

	1.Nothing
	2.Possible System malfunction
	3.Error message from the compiler
	4.Unused elements will be filled with 0's or garbage

   Answer : 4.Unused elements will be filled with 0's or garbage 

(h) What will happen if you assign a value to an element of an array
    whose subscript exceeds the size of the array?

	1.The element will be set to 0
	2.Nothing,it's done all the time
	3.Other data may be overwritten
	4.Error message from the compiler

	Answer : 3.Other data may be overwritten

(i) When u pass an array as an argument to a function,what actually gets passed?

	1.Address of the array
	2.Value of the elements of the array
	3.Address of first element of the array
	4.Number of elements of the array


   Answer : 2.Value of the elements of the array

(j) If you don't initialize a static array,what will be the element set to?

	1.0
	2.an undetermined value
	3.a floating point number
	4.the character constant'\0'

	Answer: 1.0  


(k) if int s[5] is a one-dimensional array of integers,which of the following refers
    to the third element in the array?

	1. *(s + 2)
	2. *(s + 3)
	3. s + 3
	4. s + 2

	Answer : *(s + 2)
	

   Answer : 2.Value of the elements of the array
