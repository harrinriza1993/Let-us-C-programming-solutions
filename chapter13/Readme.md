### Chapter 13 : Arrays

### [A] Answer the following

- This one is covered in `exerciseA` file.

### [B] Attempt the following

**a.c** : Write a program that interchanges the odd and even
elements of an array.

**b.c**: Write a program to copy the contents of one array into 
another in the reverse oder. 

**c.c**: Twenty-five numbers are entered from the keyboard in to
an array. The number to be searched is entered through the keyboard 
by the user. Write a program to find if the number to be searched 
is present in the array and if it is present, display the number of
times it appears in the array.

**d.c**: Twenty-five numbers are entered from keyboard in to an 
array.Write a program to find out how many of them are positive,
how many are negative, how many are even and how many odd.

**e.c**: If a array arr contains n elements, then write a program to
check if arr[0] = arr[n-1],arr[1] = arr[n-2] and so on.

**f.c**: Write a program using pointers to find the smallest
number in an array of 25 integers.

**g.c**:  Write a program which performs the following tasks:

	-- Intialize an integer array of 10 elements in main()
	-- Pass the entire array to a function modify()
	-- In modify() multiply each element of array by 3
	-- Return the control to main() and print the new array
           elements in main()

**h.c**: Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm shown in fig13.3 
on a set of 25 numbers.

	Iteration1	Iteration2	Iteration3	Iteration4	Result
        44 <--|     33		   	33 <---|	   22 <---|	 0 [11]
        33 ---|     44 <--|    		44     |	   33  	  |	 1 [22] 
        55          55 ---|	   		55     |	   44     |	 2 [33]
        22          22		   	22-----|	   55     |	 3 [44]
        11          11			11		   11 ----|	 4 [55]

**sorting**: Program for Selection, Bubble and Insertion sorting.
