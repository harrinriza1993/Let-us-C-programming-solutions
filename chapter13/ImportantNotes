Important notes:
-----------------

1. Array is a group of elements of similar datatype.

2. Syntax of array:
	datatype arrayname[size];

3. 2 ways to declare an array
	int arr[10];//mentioning size is compulsary
	int num[] = {1,2,3};//Size is optional

4. 4 types of preprocessor directives
   (a)Macro expansion
   (b)File inclusion
   (c)Conditional compilation
   (d)Miscellneous directives

5. 5 ways to access array elements using pointers:
	- Set up a pointer holding base address of array
	int arr[10],*p;
	p = arr;
	- In a for loop use one of the five expressions
	*p;p++;   OR
	*(p + i)  OR    *(i + p)
	 p[i]     OR    i[p]

6. To pass an array to a function we must always pass two things:
	1)Base address of the array 2)Size of the array

7. We cannot declare an array usint int arry[n] and then receive the value
   of n from keyboard.

8. To create a variable sized array,Use the following:
	int *p;
	p = (int *) malloc(n*sizeof(int));

	Then to access all elements we can use p[i]
