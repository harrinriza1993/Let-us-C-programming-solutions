Important notes:
-----------------

1)The control statement that allows us to make a decision from the 
  number of choices is called a switch.

2)Syntax of switch:
         switch(integer expression)
         {
            case constant 1: 	
                  do this;
	    case constant 2:	
                  do this;
            case constant 3:	
                  do this;
	    default:
                  do this;
	  }
3)Using break statement is switch is optional.

4)case value should be integer or character value.

5)we cannot relational operator and Logical operator in switch.

6)The difference between switch and if else is switch more structured
  and works faster but the disadvantage of switch is multiple cases cannot
  use same expression.

7)goto statement is used in a program to take the control whereever u want.
