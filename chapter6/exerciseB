[B] Answer the following

a. The three parts of the loop expression in the for loop are:
	1. the i _________ expression
	2. the t _________ expression
	3. the i _________ expression

	Output: initialization, test/condion expresion, increment/decrement

b. The break statement is used to exit from.
	1. An if statement
	2. A for loop
	3. A program
	4. The main() function

	Output: 2. A for loop

c. A do-while loop is useful when we want that the statement within the loop 
   must be excecuted
	1. Only once
	2. At least once
	3. More than once
	4. None of above

	Ouput: 2. At least once

d. In waht sequence the initialization, testing and excecusion of body is done 
   in a do-whikle loop?
	1. Initialization, excecution of body, testing
	2. Excecution of body, initialization, testing
	3. Initialization, testing, excecution of body
	4. None of above

	Ouput: 1. Initialization, excecution of body, testing

e. Which of the following is not an infinite loop?

	1. int i = 1;
	   while(1)
	   {
		i++;
	   }

	2. for(;;);

	3. int t = 0, f;
	   while(t)
	   {
		f=1;
	   }
	
	4. int y, x = 0;
	   do
	   {
		y=x;
	   }while(x==0

	Ouput : 3

f. Which keyword in c is used to take the control to the beginning of the loop?
	Output: continue

g. How many times in the while loop in the following C code will get executed?

	int main()
	{
		int j=1;
		while (j <= 255);
		{
			printf("%c%d", j ,j);	
			j++;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	
	output: infinite times

h. Which of the following statement is true for the following program?

	#include<stdio.h>

	int main()
	{
		int x = 100, y = 100%90;
		for(i=0; i<=10; i++);
		if(x != y)
			printf("x = %d y = %d\n",x,y);
		return 0;
	}

	1. The printf() function is called for 10 times.
	2. The program will produce the output x=10, y=10
	3. the ; after the if(x!=y) would not produce an error
	4. The program will not produce any output
	5. The printf() function is called infinite times.

	Output: 2. The program will produce the output x=10, y=10
		3. the ; after the if(x!=y) would not produce an error

i. which of the following statement is true about a for loop used in a C program?
	1. for loop works faster than while loop
	2. All things that can be done using a for loop can also be done using while loop
	3. for(;;) implements an infinite loop
	4. for lopp can be used if we want statements in a loop to get executed at least once.
	5. for loop works faster than a do-while loop.

	Output: 2. All things that can be done using a for loop can also be done using while loop
		3. for(;;) implements an infinite loop
