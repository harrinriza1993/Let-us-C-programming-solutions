Important notes:
-----------------

1)There are three types of loops
	(i)While
	(ii)do While
	(iii)for
2)While - to repeat something an unknown number of 
	  times
  for - to repeat something a fixed number of times
  
  do while - to repeat something at least once

3)for(;;)is an infinite loop.while() results into
  an error.

4)break - terminates the execution of the loop.

5)continue - abandons rest of the instruction in the loop
	     and goes for the next iteration of the loop.
