[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 0;
	for(;i;)
		printf("here is some mail for u\n");
	return 0;
    }
   
   Output: No output
   Notes:The condition [for(;0;)] become false since 'i' is equal to 0.

b. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i;

	for (i = 1;i <= 5;printf("%d\n",i));
		i++;

	return 0;
    }

   Output: 1 printed to infinity number of times.
   Notes : 1. 'i' value assigned to 1 [i=1]
	   2. condition (i<=5) is true
	   3. Then 'for()'; which is equal to 'for{}'
	   4. print the value of 'i'
	   5. Check condion, 'i' value does not changed. So 'i' value is always 1. 
	      So 1 printed to infinity number of times.

c. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 1,j = 1;

	for(;;)
	{
		if(i > 5)
			break;
		else
			j += i;

		printf("%d\n",j);
		i += j;
		return 0;
	}
    }	

   Output: 2
   Notes : In this 'for' loop is an infinity loop. since we have a return statement which return 0 
	   and exit the program.
