[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 0;
	for(;i;)
		printf("here is some mail for u\n");
	return 0;
    }
   
   Output: No output
   Notes:The condition become false since i is equal
	 to 0.

b. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i;

	for (i = 1;i <= 5;printf("%d\n",i));
		i ++;

	return 0;
    }

   Output: 1 printed to infinity number of times.
   Notes : i is always intialized to 1 since we 
	   have a semicolon in for loop.

c. #include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 1,j = 1;

	for(;;)
	{
		if(i > 5)
			break;
		else
			j += i;
	printf("%d\n",j);
	i += j;
	return 0;
	}
    }	

   Output: 2
   Notes : In this for loop is an infinity loop,
	   since we have a return statement it 
	   executes once and prints the value of
	   j once.
