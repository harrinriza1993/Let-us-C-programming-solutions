### [B] Answer the following
- This one is covered in `exerciseB` file.  

### [c] Attempt the following
- **a.c** :Write a program to print all prime numbers from  1 to 300.

- **b.c**: Write a program to add first seven terms of the following
           series 1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3!+.......7/7! using for loop.

- **c.c**:  Write a program to generate all combinations of 
            1,2,3 using for loop.

- **d.c**:Write a program to print the multiplication table of the 
     	  number entered by the user.The table should displayed in the
          following form

                     29 * 1 = 29  
	                 29 * 2 = 58 

- **e.c**: According to a study ,the approximate level of a intelligence
           of a person can be calculated using the formula:

                    i = 2 +(y+0.5x)

    Write a program that will produce a table of values of i,y and x where y varies from 1 to 6,and for each value of y,x varies from 5.5 to 12.5 in steps of 0.5.

- **f.c**:When interest compounds q times per year at an annual rate of r%
          for n years,the principal p compounds to an amount a as per the 
          following formula

                 a = p(1+r/q)^nq

    Write a Program to read 10 sets of p,r,n & q and calculate the corresponding as. 

- **g.c**: The natural logaritham can be approximated by the following series.

    		x-1/x + 1/2(x-1/x)^2 + 1/2(x-1/x)^3 + 1/2(x-1/x)^4+....

    If x is input through the keyboard,write a program to calculate
           the sum of first seven terms of this series.

- **h.c**: Write a program to generate all pythagorean Triplets with side 
           length less than or equal to 30.

- **i.c**: Population of a town today is 100000.The population has increased 
           steadily at a rate of 10% per year for last 10 years.Write a program
           to determine the population at the end of each year in the last decade

- **j.c** : Ramanujan number is the smallest number that can be expressed as
            sum of two cubes in two different ways.Write a program to print
            all such numbers up to a reasonable limit.

- **k.c** : Write a program to print 24 hours of a day with suitable 
            suffixes like AM, PM, Noon, Midnight.

- **l.c** : (l)Write a program to produce the following output
