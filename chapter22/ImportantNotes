Important notes:
-----------------

1) In computer programming, an enumerated type  is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, 
   members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type. The enumerator names are usually identifiers that behave as constants in the language. 
	
2) typedef is a reserved keyword in the programming languages. It is used to create an additional name (alias) for 
   another data type, but does not create a new type, except in the obscure case of a qualified typedef of an array 
   type where the typedef qualifiers are transferred to the array element type.

3) In programming terminology, a bit field is a data structure that allows the programmer to allocate memory to structures and unions 
   in bits in order to utilize computer memory in an efficient manner. Since structures and unions are user-defined data types in C, 
   the user has an idea of how much memory will they occupy.
   
4) Function Pointers point to code like normal pointers. In Functions Pointers, function's name can be used to get function's address. 
   A function can also be passed as an arguments and can be returned from a function.
   
5) A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union 
   with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location 
   for multiple-purpose.
