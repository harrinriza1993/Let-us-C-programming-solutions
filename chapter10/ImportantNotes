Important notes:
-----------------

1. A function that call itself is called a recursive function.

2. Any function ,including main()can become a recursive function.

3. Recursive call always leads to an infinite loop.So a provision
   must be made to get outside this infinite loop.

4. Recursive function may or maynot have a return statement.

5. Recursion is an alternate for loop in logics which are 
   expressible in the form of themselves.
