[A] What will be the output of the following program.

a. #include<stdio.h>
   int main()
   {
	printf("C to it that C survives\n");
	main();
	return 0;
    }

   output: C to it that C survives
	   (printed infinited infinity times)
	  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

   Note  : Since we call main() in main function, main() will get called itself
           at infinity times and prints "C to it that C survives" at infinity times.
	 
	   At certain point, there is no memory to save the main() function,
	   so segmentation fault occurs.


b. include<stdio.h>

   int main()
   {
	int i = 0;

	i++;
	if (i<=5)
	{
		printf("c adds wings to your thoughts\n");
		exit(0);
		main();
	}
	return 0;
   }

   Output:c adds wings to your thoughts
   Notes: exit(0) is used in the function after printf statement.
          so the program will be terminated.so it cannot call the
          main function.
