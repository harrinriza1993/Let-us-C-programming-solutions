/*There are three pegs labeled A,B and C.Four disks are placed on 
  pegA.The bottom-most disk is largest, and disks go on decreasing 
  in size with the topmost dis being the smallest.The objective of 
  the game is to move the disk from pegA to pegC,using pegB as an 
  auxillary peg.The rules of the game are as follows:

  (1) Only one disk may be moved at a time,and it must be the top
      disk on one of the pegs.
  (2) A larger disk should be placed on the top of a smaller disk.
  (3) Write a program to print out the sequence in which the disks
      should be moved such that all disks on pegA are finally 
      transferred to pegC.
