### Chapter 10 : Recursion

### [A] What will be the output of the following program

- This one is covered in `exerciseA` file.

### [B] Attempt the following

**a.c** : A 5-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a
recursive and a non-recursive function to calculate sum of digits of the 5 digit number.

**b.c**: A positive integer in entered through the keyboard, write a program
to obtain the prime factors of the number. Modify the function suitably to 
obtain the prime factors recursively.

**c.c**: Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of 
a Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of twosucessive 
terms gives the third term. Following are the firstfew terms of the 

    Fibonacci sequence:    1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89.

**d.c**: A positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write
a function to find the binary equivalent of this number
  1) Without using recursion
  2) Using recursion

**e.c**: Write a recursive function to obtain the sum of first 25 natural numbers.

**f.c**: There are three pegs labeled A,B and C. Four disks are placed on pegA.
The bottom-most disk is largest, and disks go on decreasing in size with the 
topmost dis being the smallest. The objective of the game is to move the disk 
from pegA to pegC,using pegB as an auxillary peg. The rules of the game are as follows:

  (1) Only one disk may be moved at a time,and it must be the top disk on one of the pegs.  
  (2) A larger disk should be placed on the top of a smaller disk.  
  (3) Write a program to print out the sequence in which the disks should be moved such that all disks on pegA are finally transferred to pegC.  

**g.c**: If a positive integer is entered through the keyboard,write a  recursive 
function to obtain the primefactors of the number.
