Important notes:
-----------------

1)A function is a self contained block of statements that performs a coherent task
  of some kind.

2)There are 2 types of function.
	predefined function - Functions which already definition in header files
	eg : printf(),scanf()
   	userdefined function - Functions that we create in a program 
	eg : void message()

3)Syntax of a function:
 	return_type function_name(argument list)
	{
		set of statements - Block of code
	}

4)Writing functions avoid rewriting the same code over and over.

5)Actual Parameters:
 	The values/Variables passed while calling a function are called 
	actual parameters

6)Formal Parameters:
 	These are the variables declared in a function prototype and receive their
	values when a call to the function is made.
