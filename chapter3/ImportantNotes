Important notes:
-----------------
1. Three ways of taking decisions in a program :
	1) Using if-else statement
	2) Using conditional operators
	3) Using the switch statement
	
2. General form of decision control instruction :
	if(condition)
		statemrnt1;
	else
		statement2;
		
3. If more than 1 statement is present inside if or else {} is necessary.

4. Condition is built using relation operators <,>,<=,>=,==,!=.

5. Any non-zero number is true, 0 is false.
