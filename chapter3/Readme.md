### [C] Attempt the following

**a.c** : If cost price and selling price of an item are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller

**c.c** : Any year is input through the keyboard. Write a program to determine whether the year is leap year or not.
    	(Hint : Use the %(modulus) operator)

**d.c** : According to Gregorian calendar, it was Monday on the date 1/1/01. If any year is input through the keyboard
write a program to find what is the day on 1st january of this year.

**e.c** : A five-digit number is entered through the keyboard. Write a program to obtain the reversed number and to determine

**f.c** : If ages of Ram, Shyam and Ajay are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine the youngest of the three.

**g.c** : Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when three angles are entered through the keyboard. A 
triangle is valid if the sum of all three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

**h.c** : Write a program to find the absolute value of a number entered through the keyboard.

**i.c** : Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the area of rectangle is greater than it's perimeter. 
For example, the area of rectangle with length = 5 and breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter.

**j.c** : Given three points(x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), write a program to check if all three points fall on one straight line.

**k.c** : Given the coordinates(x, y) of a center of a circle and its radius, write a program that will determine whether a point lies 
inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle. 

	(Hint : Use sqrt() and pow() functions)

**l.c** :Given a point (x,y), write a program to find out if it lies X-axis, Y-axis or on the origin.
